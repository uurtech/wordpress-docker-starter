* Important - Front-end script heavily refactored to facilitate integrations with 3rd party code. Notable changes:
   - JS single-page app logic rewritten using a BackboneJS core. Compatibility with the existing PHP templating logic is maintained since views do not rely on JS templates for updating data.
   - Introduced JS API for accessing various Composite properties including prices, availability status, validation messages and component configuration data.
   - Introduced JS Actions API for dispatching model/view actions in response to key events. The Actions API (add_action, do_action, remove_action) is similar to the familiar WP Actions PHP API.
   - Introduced JS Filters API to allow filtering key app variables. The Filters API (add_filter, apply_filters, remove_filter) is similar to the familiar WP Filters PHP API.
* Important - Various minor but critical modifications to multiple PHP template files. Please update any overridden template files.
* Feature - Browser history support when navigating between Composite steps, powered by a BackboneJS router.
* Feature - "Non-blocking" behaviour for Scenarios when using the Stacked layout.

"Non-Blocking" behaviour: A selection in the Nth component constrains only the active options of the components that follow it. A component selection is cleared when an incompatible option is selected in a preceding component.

* Fix - Rounding issues with display prices incl/excl tax and prices defined excl/incl tax when quantity > 1. All JS price calculations are now carried out using 4th decimal precision.
* Fix - Added price suffix to JS-generated total. To calculate prices incl/excl tax, prices passed to the script are now raw, instead of based on the 'tax_display_shop' setting.
* Fix - Added 'composite_parent' and 'composite_children' keys to WC API order response data, to assist in establishing Composite Products parent/child item relationships.
* Fix - Modified composite parent/child weight and dimension keys in WC API order response data, depending on the "Per-Item Shipping" option state and exact cart package content.
* Fix - Limited use of 'woocommerce_get_item_count' filter within the front-end "My Account" area.

To avoid issues in cart when the "Per-Item Pricing" option is checked, all container cart item properties are set to their base price counterparts when session data is loaded.
* Fix - Handling of composited products in coupons. Coupon validity of composited items is now inherited from their parents - specifically: A coupon cannot be valid for a composited item if the composite that contains it is excluded from the coupon.
